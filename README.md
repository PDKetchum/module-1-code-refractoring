# module-1-code-refractoring

## Overview

To fulfill my client's user story request, I created a codebase that followed their accesibility standards to optimize their search engines.

I reviewed edited their html and css files to make sure:

- All links were working correctly
- To consolidate CSS selectors and properties
- Organize CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- Include any comments in the CSS and HTML files
- All accessibility standards were met

I learned a lot about different semantic HTML elements. While I was working on fixing and consilidating code, I hit alot of bumps on the road that made me realize how important attention of detail is for coding. A typo can throw off the whole output of a page.
